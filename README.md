# Utilites 

## A collection of utilites I have built to handle log parsing and shell scripting using Bash, Python, and C#

### Amazon Log parser
#### Two versions, a Bash and a Python version. The Bash version was too slow for very large logs, so I used Python as a faster alternative.

### IIS Log parser
#### C# console application to parse an IIS log file based on a target IP address. Returns the date, method and uri stem to the console, or optionally to a text file.

### Mac Logon Script
#### For Macs in an Active Directory domain a script to mount network shares. Includes a plist file to setup when the script is run.

### Bash SMTP Telnet tests
#### A basic Telnet script to test SMTP, POP3, and IMAP for a given IP address with some color coding.
