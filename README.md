# Utilites 

## A collection of utilites I have built to handle log parsing and shell scripting using Bash, Python, and C#

### Amazon Log parser
#### Two versions, a Bash and a Python version. The Bash version was too slow for large logs, so I tried Python and it ran blazingly fast.


### Mac Logon Script
#### If you ever need to have Macs in an Active Directory domain mount network shares, this will do it. Also includes a plist file to dictate when the script is run.

### Bash SMTP Telnet tests
#### A basic Telnet script to test SMTP, POP#, and IMAP for a given IP address with some fancy color coding.
